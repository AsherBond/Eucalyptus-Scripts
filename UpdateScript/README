Update Recipe
--------------

This recipe has been created to automatically update a CentOS 6 or Debian 6 
image as soon as it is started. 

Details
-------

The recipe will check if the file /etc/redhat-release for CentOS or
/etc/debian-version for Debian is existing on the system to use the 
specific command to update the linux distribution.

I struggled with this for a while using different methods.

* using lsb_release is not a good idea as it is not installed by default 
	on a CentOS minimal distribution
* the /etc/proc file using different columns on various OS
* /etc/issue is not working because of permissions issues also, the
	administrator can manually change this file.


Usage
-----

Make sure you have a security group which allow for port 22 (SSH) to be
open: 

	euca-add-group -d "default group" default
	euca-authorize -p 22 -P tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 default

When starting with one of your debian-, centos-based images you can do something
like

	euca-run-instance -k XXXX emi-XXXXXX -f update.sh 

REMARKS
-------

This recipe has been used to install a puppet agent into each instance, it's
also possible to package your /etc/puppet tree with for example fpm distributing 
it online and installing this tree into the launched instance so you can immediately
use the puppet functionality
