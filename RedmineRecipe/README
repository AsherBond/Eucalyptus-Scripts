Redmine Recipe
--------------

This recipe is to be used with our test images (debian-based). It will
install and configure redmine on an instance. The database is assumed to
be on a different instance, and in our case we use the simple postgres
script in PostgresRecipe.

Details
-------

The scripts needs to have s3curl credentials to access private buckets
where the configuration is stored. The credentials and walrus endpoint are
defined at the beginning of the script and they will need to be configured
each time. 

The script will then acquire s3curl-euca.pl from a known location and use
it to access the private bucket for the configuration files. 


Usage
-----

Since the instance is configured to run apache2-ssl, port 443 will need
to be available, and usually port 22 (ssh) will be opened for maintenance
purposes. To create a new security group and add the right permissions you
can then:

	euca-add-group -d "redmine security group" redmine
	euca-authorize -p 443 -P tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 redmine
	euca-authorize -p 22 -P tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 redmine

	
When starting with one of our debian-based images you can do something
like

	euca-run-instance -f redmine.sh -g redmine -i mykey.priv emi-XXXXXX
