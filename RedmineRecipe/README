Redmine Recipe
--------------

This recipe is to be used with our test images (debian-based). It will
install and configure redmine on an instance. The database is assumed to
be on a different instance, and in our case we use the simple postgres
script in PostgresRecipe.

Right now if very crude but it gets the job done to create our frintend for
projects.eucalyptus.com.

Usage

When starting with one of our debian-based images you can do something
like
