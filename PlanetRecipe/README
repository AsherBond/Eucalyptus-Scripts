Planet Recipe
--------------

This script is to be sued with our test images (debian based). It will
install and configure planet (http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/). This
is the script we use for
	http://planet.eucalyptus.com

Usage
-----

Make sure you have a security group that allows for connections to the web
server. Tipically these are port 80 (http) and 443 (https). We usually add
port 22 (ssh). For example

	euca-add-group -d "webserver security group" webserver
	euca-authorize -p 80 -P tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 webserver
	euca-authorize -p 443 -P tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 webserver
	euca-authorize -p 22 -P tcp -s 0.0.0.0/0 webserver

When starting with one of our debian-based images you can do something
like

	euca-run-instance -k XXX -g webserver emi-XXXXXX -f planet.sh

Since we have an elastic ip associate with the planet, the last step is to
associate it to the running instance

	euca-associate-address -i i-XXXXX planet.eucalyptus.com
