Eucalyptus Scripts
------------------

This repository contains various scripts used with Eucalyptus. For example
it contains what we use to implement the SLA (Service Level Agreements)
for the ECC (Eucalyptus Community Cloud at http://open.eucalyptus.com/try).
Others examples will be scripts used with our test images (which are
provided on http://open.eucalyptus.com).

Structure
---------

Each scripts (or set of) is a mini-project, thus each one should reside in
its own directory with a README to explain what it is doing and how to use
it.

Participate
-----------

Since you are already reading this, you are already participating! To
add/modify scripts you can of course use github or
http://projects.eucalyptus.com (to be live at the end of summer 2011).

For any question feel free to contact community@eucalyptus.com.
